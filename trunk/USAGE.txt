USAGE file : short documentation on how to use this software.

You have essentially 3 possible actions:
1) press the scan new file to scan a new document and add it to the database
2) press the add file button to import an existing file to the database
3) type any combination of word in the search text area then press enter in order to get a list of documents
   that corresponds to the selected tags.

once you have selected a document, you can preview it by using the next/previous page buttons, or start the system command
associated with it by clicking on the <system show> button.


This is a first version of the documentation, outrageously short and obvious, but it's just to start with something...
