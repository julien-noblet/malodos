This page is aimed to explain the user how to deal with the MALODOS interface. The common tasks are explained step by step (using screenshots), and a detailed view of all the available functionalities is given for more advanced (or less hurry) users.

= Introduction =

MALODOS is a software I decided to develop after so many hours of frustrating attempts to find a very important invoice that I knew I had somewhere but didn't knew EXACTLY where.

So I started to look for a soft that could help me to scan and manage my papers, so that I would be able to find them easily by modern computer aided search engines.
In the market, I didn't found any piece of soft which completely satisfies my needs.

These request were :
  # simple to use
  # not too expensive
  # not taking me as an hostage so I will not be *forced* to use the same program in 20 years if I still want to access my files.

I actually used paperarchiver () for a while, until I realized that, if this program is not maintained, or if I decided to completely quit the MS WINDOWS environment, I would not be able to retrieve my data from the undocumented database / image format used by this soft. Apart from that, paperarchiver satisfied me, I must admit. However, the last point was very important and for that reason I decided to start developing my own code.

Note : after having presenting a first alpha version of this soft into forums, I was advised to have a look on pap'rass software, which effectively could respond to my needs. But after having starting coding, you can't never stop...

So the MALODOS project born, and you're now visiting its helper page. And actually, you'll get a software which
  # is simple to use (actually I hope so...)
  # is not too expensive (no charge, however feel free to donate something if you think it deserves it)
  # not taking you as an hostage (hereafter all the data format will be explained, and images are basically standard pdf files)

= Quick overview of the Graphical Interface =

http://malodos.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/MALODOS_mainBoard.png

The main board of MALODOS is basically divided into 4 parts.
  # The toolbar  - gives you access to the document management, such as scanning a new document, adding an existing file to the database or deleting documents.
  # The search field  - allows you to find any document containing the requested terms.
  # The documents list  - presenting the complete list of documents corresponding to the terms defined in the search field (or all documents if the search field is empty).
  # The current document details - allows you to preview the document itself, to open it via your standard OS program, to print it directly or to update the meta-information attached to it (see below for details).

  
All these elements will be described in details in the end of this page, but let start with some learn-by-example cases first.

== Scanning a new document ==

The most basic operation you will do with MALODOS is to scan a document and add it to the database.
So let start with it.

First, open the scanner dialog (2nd button from the left). In this dialog, you will have first to choose you scanner (select scanner button). Note that, for the time being, your choice is not recorded, but this will be added later.
If you have a muliple-page document and do not use an automatic charging trail, check the 'manual muliscan' button.
Now you can start the scan by pressing the 'start scan' button. Once the scanning process accomplished, fill in the meta-data fields : title, description, document date (day of scan by default), and tag list. The tag list must be a comma separated list of terms allowing to easily search and classify yous documents database.
Once finished, just press the 'done' button and that's it!

== Adding an existing document to your database ==

The second most common operation consists of adding existing scanned file in order to index them (more useful if you already have scanned other documents, indeed).
There's actually two ways to perform this operation.
The first one, just consists to press the add file button (1st button from the left), and then select the file to add.
After that, you just have to fill the meta-data fields (like for the new scanned document described before). And press the done button.
This method work perfectly well if you just have a few documents to add.
However, if you have more than a few tens of files, selecting them individually (and thus navigating through your system's folder multiple times) may be somewhat harassing.
In such a case, you can just use the folder survey method, by using the corresponding button (5th button from the left).
This will open a new dialog with the list of all the document files (pdf, tif,...) in the folders you have selected (from the preference window, see below) and not already present in your database.
You can then, select each of them successively, and fill their corresponding meta-data. Don't forget to press the 'add' button before selecting anew document, in order to record the current edited file.
When you have finish this process, just press the 'done' button to return to the main board.

== Setting preferences ==
As mentioned above, the list of folder which have to be surveyed can be specified within the preference dialog, accessible via the corresponding button (6th button from the left).
