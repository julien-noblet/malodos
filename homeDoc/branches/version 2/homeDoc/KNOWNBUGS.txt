----------

* The file signature (MD5 checksum) is made at the creation time and recorded to the database. If, during a subsequent
  access the checksum, the user have the possibility to update this signature (if it is relevant). The update is actually made but
  not well taken into account until the program is restarted. Probably a problem of cache... It's quite ennoying but file checksums
  should not be changed very often, so I postponed the debug of this problem and sent it to a pre-release...
