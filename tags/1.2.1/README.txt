MALODOS (for MAnagement of LOcal DOcument System) is simple but usefull software aimed to help the process of archiving and navigate between the documents presents in your harddrive.

It is written in python and mainly merges numereous external libraries to give a fast and simple way to scan and numerically record your personal documents (such as invoices, taxe declaration, etc...)

Being written in python, it is portable (works on windows and linux at least, not tested on other systems)

The libraries onto which it is built are essentially:
- pysqlite3 (and thus sqlite, for database management)
- twain (for scanner access under windows)
- sane (for scanner access under linux)
- PIL
- wxpython (and thus wxwidgets) for the GUI
- swftools (for pdf reading)
- pypdf (for pdf creation)
