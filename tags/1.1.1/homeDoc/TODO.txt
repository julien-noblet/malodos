TODO file : LIST THE NEXT FEATURES WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN NEXT RELEASES

28/07/2010
----------

* localization (probably have to use the gettext library)
DONE * add a zoom / pan option for the embedded document previewer
* add a print document option
* documentation (in code and user guide)
DONE * adding a survey option that will help to give an alarm if a document file is added in a user requested folder.
* adding options to search for documents with logical operators / regular expression...
* adding a fulltext search option, which imply to implement an OCR processing of the content of bitmap image files
  and a specific access for Microsoft Word / Open Office / other text file formats
* the code actually uses many different libraries to read/write the image files (namely : pypdf to write pdf, swftools to read pdf,
  wxwidget to read G4 tiff files, and PIL for other raster formats). This induces many dependencies that may be avoided
  by re-encoding some of them or by finding a library that can do it for me (must be portable under windows/linux).
* package the software in order to facilitate the installation by non technician users...
DONE * add a tag field
* helps the user to choose relevant tag according to the other fields contents (probably needs a fulltext field to work)
* add the document to go option
* add many folder / sub folder for each document (car insurance can be classified in car or insurance...)
	should be better to automatically create virtual folders...
* add an encryption capability
